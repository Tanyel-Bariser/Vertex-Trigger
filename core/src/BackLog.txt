DEFECTS:
• Tween death animation properly or Remove unused death sprites [Hugh look into this]
• Game is much slower on big screen, when connecting my laptop to a TV [Tanyel look into this]
• Game crashes if bullets are lingering after death on Android, i.e. not destroyed [POSSIBLY FIXED CANNOT REPRODUCE - Tanyel to look into this]

• Bullet should be destroyed once below a certain velocity
• Music is restarted at player death
• Sound effects don't work first time on Android
• Replace jump button with an up arrow
• Find portal sprite
• Enemy shouldn't be pushed so easily by player
• Refactor a class and update its unit tests so they all pass

GAME DESIGN EXPLORATION:
	What if we created a flying monster that shot metal spiked balls, which also bounce off of platforms and
go through portals in the same way the players bullets do. This will make the game play sort of like the Atari
Breakout game where the player has to work out exactly where the metal spiked balls would land after bouncing
and teleporting around in order to avoid them. In addition we could have magnets in these levels which pull on
the metal spiked balls so they curve.
	To make this more interesting we could allow the player to choose whether or not to pick up a metallic,
bubble like, shield which on the one hand would guard him from the metallic spiked balls, but on the other
hand cause him to be pulled to-and-fro by the magnets into other potential dangers. This would give the player
an interesting choice to decide whether or not picking up the metallic shield is advantageous for that
particular level.
	This concept could be extended into a main theme of the game where each world, i.e. set of levels, has a
unique power up, each of which has its own combination of pros and cons forcing the player to choose whether
or not it is worth picking up for each particular level.
	Another example that might be worth exploring could be an under water world, where the player starts off
under water in each level and has a limited amount of oxygen, i.e. time, to complete the level and has the choice
to pick up a bubble, which allows him to breathe under water, i.e. have unlimited time, but has the disadvantage
of making him jump extra high in a set of levels with spiked ceilings or be within jumping height of other enemies.
