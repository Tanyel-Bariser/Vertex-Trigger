Defects:
� [mobile] Needs performance testing, i.e. log GC cycles. Sometimes game simulation stops, we think it's due to excessive asset load - Cache everything, especially sprites upfront so not garbage
� [mobile] Zoom needs adjusting because the bee is often not in view due to the screen being rectangular and not square like the desktop version

Assets:
� Sprite for magnet
� Sprite for metallic shield
� Bee shoot sound

Game:
� Implement bullet ricochet sound
� Bee bullets shouldn't bounce and should be a sting sprite

� When player picks up shield:
	collisiondetector
	shield.set(player) sets shield's body sensor==false and fixes it's position as player's position

shield is fixed onto Player body, which is part of SteerableBody and creates a magnet and injects itself into the magnet

shield initialized as sensor=true so that player can 'merge' with it and bullets don't bounce off 
then after pickup this boolean is flipped making it a real 'hard' body

must handle player bullets not deflecting off inside of shield

player should probably have an 'immune to projectiles' boolean set when wearing shield. 
this means we can have player feet sticking outside of shield body (so player can walk and jump), but that the player will not have an achilles heel.
i.e. the shield sprite will be bigger than its body

GAME DESIGN EXPLORATION:
	What if we created a flying monster that shot metal spiked balls, which also bounce off of platforms and
go through portals in the same way the players bullets do. This will make the game play sort of like the Atari
Breakout game where the player has to work out exactly where the metal spiked balls would land after bouncing
and teleporting around in order to avoid them. In addition we could have magnets in these levels which pull on
the metal spiked balls so they curve.
	To make this more interesting we could allow the player to choose whether or not to pick up a metallic,
bubble like, shield which on the one hand would guard him from the metallic spiked balls, but on the other
hand cause him to be pulled to-and-fro by the magnets into other potential dangers. This would give the player
an interesting choice to decide whether or not picking up the metallic shield is advantageous for that
particular level.
	This concept could be extended into a main theme of the game where each world, i.e. set of levels, has a
unique power up, each of which has its own combination of pros and cons forcing the player to choose whether
or not it is worth picking up for each particular level.
	Another example that might be worth exploring could be an under water world, where the player starts off
under water in each level and has a limited amount of oxygen, i.e. time, to complete the level and has the choice
to pick up a bubble, which allows him to breathe under water, i.e. have unlimited time, but has the disadvantage
of making him jump extra high in a set of levels with spiked ceilings or be within jumping height of other enemies.
	Fire shield that protects against fire balls but burns platforms the player stands on so they disappear.
	Lever to flood fire level to make it into an under water level.
